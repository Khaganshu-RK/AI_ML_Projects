# This folder contains Post Graduate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning final Projects:


# 1. Building an Conversational Chatbot

•Build a chatbot from scratch using Cornell University's Movie Dialogue corpus.
•Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing concepts using Deep learning based architecture with the main components as LSTM based encoder and decoder.
•This chatbot understands users' different intents and makes it extremely simple to work around by presenting the users with options and recommendations that best suit their needs.


# 2. Actions recognition using Pose Estimation

•Convolutional Neural Network based pose estimation for body landmark detection and pose features-based action recognition and its improvement using graphical feature representation and data augmentation of body landmarks.
•Implemented CNN-based Pose Estimation model and NN-based Action Recognition model and Action Recognition in videos using pose joints estimated by the CNN model.
•By applying deep learning-based algorithms for action recognition on the live feed, Real-time detection and alerting of suspicious activities or actions can be performed.


# 3. Machine Learning model for Auto Insurance Industry

•Build a Machine Learning Model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.
•The project involves the use of a dataset with 600k training data and 57 features/data. Performed EDA on the dataset. Started with the basic model but eventually move towards ensemble. Used Deep Learning with sklearn MLPClassifier and check if the Neural Network Model is better than traditional models. Arrived at a model with best f1-score.
•This model will help Insurance company in capturing market share by lowering the prices of the premium for the customers, who are least likely to claim and charge the right premium from the customer, who is likely to claim insurance in the coming year.
